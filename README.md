### P1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

Given a number of characteristics of a house, can we predict its price? That's the aim of this project. We'll build an optimal model based on the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas.
